This file is a README file that describes the physical environment
suitable for the pick and place program to work properly.

Baxter is positioned on a floor with his left side next to a table.
The home position of the left arm is chosen so the gripper is hovering 310mm over the table.
The table is white or covered with white paper or fabric.
Two wooden cubes (50mm), light in colour, are on the table to interact with.
One piece is placed on the table under the home position.
The other cube has pieces of paper attached to 5 sides, each with an image of a shape on it.
The shapes are Circle, Triangle, Cross, Star and Square.
The shapes are solid black with a white background.
The cube with the shapes on it is placed so the gripper comes down and can grabs the flat sides and not the corners.
